# AmazonWebScraping
A simple Amazon scraper project using Python involves building a script that automatically retrieves information about products from the Amazon website. The script uses Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, requests, and lxml to scrape the HTML code of a product's Amazon page and extract specific details like product name, price, rating, and reviews.

The scraper project can also be designed to crawl through multiple product pages, or even search results, to retrieve data for multiple products. The scraped data can be stored in a CSV file or a database for further analysis or use.

This project can be useful for researchers, marketers, and sellers who want to track prices, monitor reviews, or gather product information for analysis or comparison. However, it's important to note that web scraping should be done ethically and within the bounds of Amazon's Terms of Service.
